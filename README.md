# Video Player -By Shekhar

Hello, world! Welcome to my git project where I have created the ultimate video player that supports captions like no other. Not only can you watch your favorite movies and shows with subtitles in any language, but you can also customize them to your liking. Change the font, color, size, position, and even the timing of the captions with a simple click. But wait, there's more! I have also invented a new subtitle file format that is compatible with this player. It is called .wss and it is amazing. It allows you to add title,author,publisher,Date, note, license and subtitle in multiple language. How cool is that? If you want to try it out, just download the player and the .wss files from this repository and enjoy. Don't forget to leave a star ‚≠ê and a comment üí¨ if you like it.
also If want to contribute help me to fix known bugs

 Thanks for your support!
